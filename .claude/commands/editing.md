# Editing Helper

For the $ARGUMENTS file ensure there are no grammatical or spelling errors, if there are fix these and nothing else.  

For section titles indicated with `#`, `##`, etc. ensure they use consistent capitalization, with the main page title having the first letter of every word capitalized and other section titles only capitalizing the first word of the title.
