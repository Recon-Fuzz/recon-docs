# Introduction

In this simple article we'll use Create Chimera App to create a simple Contract and run Invariant Tests on it

## Writing the Contract

Let's write a simple contract that given a deposit will vest your points over time

```solidity
    
```

## Setup

Deploy the Contract

## Target Functions

Build them with Extension / UI

## Why no Ghost Variables
