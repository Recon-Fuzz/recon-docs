# Alerts 

The _Alerts_ page is where you can view all the alerts for your fuzzing jobs. 

Alerts are triggered on recurring jobs and live monitoring jobs. 
- recurring jobs - are run on a time schedule and test your invariants against the current state of the chain. 
- live monitoring jobs - are run every block and test your invariants against the current state of the chain. 

From this page you can create and view alerts for your jobs.
