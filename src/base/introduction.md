# Introduction 

Recon is a tool for automatically scaffolding and running invariant testing in the cloud.

We also maintain a suite of tools that help with invariant testing and security research more generally.

## Creating An Account

To get started using Recon's free tools, you don't need to create an account and can use any of the tools in the [Free Recon Tools](../tools/medusa_scraper.md) section. 

To use more advanced features (running jobs in the cloud, alerts, etc.) you'll need to [create an account](https://getrecon.xyz/auth/signin?callbackUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgetrecon.xyz%2Fdashboard) using your GitHub account and sign up for Recon Pro. 

Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to the dashboard where you'll have access to all of the tools in the Recon suite.

## Learn Invariant Testing

Most of our guides and documentation are focused on using fuzzing tools, primarily [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Medusa](https://github.com/crytic/medusa) because we use them internally at Recon. However, we also support running other tools on our cloud infrastructure such as [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) (fuzzing), [Halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos) (formal verification), and [Kontrol](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol) (formal verification). 

After having chosen a tool best suited to your needs and downloading it locally, you can get started by running jobs directly on the jobs pge.

If you're new to invariant testing, we recommend you starting with the following posts: 

1. [First Day At Invariant School](https://getrecon.substack.com/p/first-day-at-invariant-school?r=34r2zr)
2. [How To Define Invariants](https://getrecon.substack.com/p/how-to-define-invariants?r=34r2zr)
3. [Implementing Your First Smart Contract Invariants: A Practical Guide](https://getrecon.substack.com/p/implementing-your-first-few-invariants?r=34r2zr)

If you prefer a full end-to-end video bootcamp, checkout [this series](https://getrecon.xyz/bootcamp) on everything you need to know about invariant testing.

Once you've grasped the basics of invariant testing you can setup your first suite and run it on Recon. For a step-by-step guide on how to do this, check out the [First Steps](./first_steps.md) guide.

<!-- or use the documentation in the _Using Recon_ section to help guide you.  -->
