# Introduction 

Recon is a tool for automatically scaffolding and running invariant testing in the cloud.

## Getting Started

To get started with Recon, you'll need to create an account using your GitHub account. 

Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to the dashboard where you can run a new job. To run a job you'll need a Recon Pro account. The other tools in the Recon suite are free to use without a Pro account. 

Most of our guides and documentation are focused on using fuzzing tools, primarily [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and [Medusa](https://github.com/crytic/medusa) because we use them internally at Recon. However, we also support running other tools on our cloud infrastructure such as [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), [Halmos](https://github.com/a16z/halmos) and [Kontrol](https://github.com/runtimeverification/kontrol). 

After having chosen a tool best suited to your needs and downloading it locally, you can then learn more about how to define properties on a smart contract system with these posts: 

If you've never created an invariant testing suite before, we recommend you start with [this post](https://getrecon.substack.com/p/first-day-at-invariant-school?r=34r2zr). 

You can then learn more about how to define properties on a smart contract system with these posts: 
- [How To Define Invariants](https://getrecon.substack.com/p/how-to-define-invariants?r=34r2zr)
- [Implementing Your First Smart Contract Invariants: A Practical Guide](https://getrecon.substack.com/p/implementing-your-first-few-invariants?r=34r2zr)

Now you're ready to start implementing your first invariant testing suite and running it on Recon. You can learn more about how to do that in the [First Steps](./first_steps.md) guide or use the documentation in the _Using Recon_ section to help guide you.
