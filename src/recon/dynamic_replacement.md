Dynamic Replacement allows you to replace the value of any variable in your contracts

This can be extremely useful if you're exploring multiple variants or behaviours in your code

Many engineers write config files to track:
- Max Precision Loss
- Number of Actors

And other aspects of the suite

With Dynamic Replacement you can change one line, click a button and run multiple jobs which have different configurations, without needing to manage multiple branches

The code is replaced before running the fuzzer, with every other config remaining the same
