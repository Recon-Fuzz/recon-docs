Common sense notes about working remotely

## Make your work visible

If you don't post on social media you're dead

It's not the truth, but we fell it that way

Same for remote work, if we don't see it, it didn't happen

Make it a habit to:
- Post your progress daily in a non disruptive way
- Upload your notes for others to benefit

## Don't force others to ask stupid questions

Always clean up useless branches

Simplify PRs to ensure everyone's attention goes towards what matters

Send a latest run if possible

What's the point of asking you:
- What's the latest run?
- Where's the code?
- What's the last branch?

If you already know you'll be asked this, just make it visible

## Push the work, don't just check boxes

With AI there's close to zero value in someone that fills in some check boxes

Your work is as valuable as it's hard to turn into an algorithm

Your willingness to think about the needs of the customer or the enterprise is what makes your work valuable, not the effort itself

Think about this: Once a piece of software is done and fully specced, you could write a simple tool to build it instantly, the value you created was in figuring that out, not in simply following an algorithm
