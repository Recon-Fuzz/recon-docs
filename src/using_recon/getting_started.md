# Getting Started 

## Creating An Account

To get started using Recon's free tools, you don't need to create an account and can use any of the tools in the [Free Recon Tools](../free_recon_tools/recon_extension.md) section. 

To use more advanced features (running jobs in the cloud, alerts, etc.) you'll need to [create an account](https://getrecon.xyz/auth/signin?callbackUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgetrecon.xyz%2Fdashboard) using your GitHub account and sign up for Recon Pro. 

Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to the dashboard where you'll have access to all of the tools in the Recon suite.
