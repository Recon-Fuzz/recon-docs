# Getting Started

## Creating An Account

To get started using Recon's free tools, you don't need to create an account and can use any of the tools in the [Free Recon Tools](../free_recon_tools/recon_extension.md) section.

To use more advanced features (running jobs in the cloud, alerts, etc.) you'll need to [create an account](https://getrecon.xyz/auth/signin?callbackUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fgetrecon.xyz%2Fdashboard) using your GitHub account and sign up for Recon Pro.

Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to the dashboard where you'll have access to all of the tools in the Recon suite.

## Using Private Repositories

To use Recon with your private repositories, you need to install the Recon GitHub App:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Installs](https://getrecon.xyz/dashboard/installs)
2. Click **"Manage Recon Github App Installations"**
3. Select which repositories you want Recon to access

The Recon App only has read access to your code. It cannot modify your repositories (except for writing to Issues if you use [Campaigns](./campaigns.md)).

Once installed, your private repos will appear in the repository dropdown when creating jobs or using [Recon Magic](./recon_magic.md).
